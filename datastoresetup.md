I went with MySQL for this because it's reliable and works well with python.
It also works pretty well with docker and is generally the software I'm most familiar with, out of the options.
I wanted to make sure that I could use docker for this too and SQL went along with it quite well.
Overall I think this was a pretty strong combo of the most well known softwares
which have earned their popularity for a good reason.


To start MySQL: open command prompt and type
docker-compose up -d

This will create the database and prepare a table for the incoming data
